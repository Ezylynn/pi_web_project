This is a website to host a competition for students to type as many pi word as possible.

The main programming languages will be used for this repo will be:
- EJS (HTML) - A templating engine used for dynamic HTMLs
- CSS - Adding styles to HTML
- Client-side JavaScript - Adding movements to HTML and CSS, creating fetch requests
- Nodejs - Using the express framework for routing, middlewares (authorization), passport for authentication, bcrypt for hashing
- PostgreSQL - Storing students table and results table


This web will offer two different interfaces for both students and teachers:
- Students interact with the testing page
- Teachers interact with the administrator page


This is our first collab project and hopefully it will go well =))
